### More

GitHub offers much more than things listed here. With it you can create different versions of your project. Bring back 
old state of documents in case when you deleted some useful information. Allow others to clone your project and develop 
it as they like. Other people can propose changes useful for you. Then you decide whether you want to include them or 
not. [Read more](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
