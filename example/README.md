Here you can find example notebook generated with [pdoc3-mdnotes](https://ethru.github.io/pdoc3-mdnotes/index.html). 
Notes are divided into three categories:

### [First section: GitHub](https://ethru.github.io/pdoc3-mdnotes/example/github_beginners_guide.html)

It is beginner friendly introduction to GitHub for people who were never programming before. I assume you may be new to 
tools presented here. No worries. I will walk you through it gently. There will be no need to turn on terminal and write
even single line of code. Everything will be done in your browser. It's just simple like that.

***Note:** if you have used GitHub before I guess that you are far more advanced than information collected in this 
guide. Its purpose is to encourage people without any technical experience to give those tools chance.*

### [Second section: Markdown](https://ethru.github.io/pdoc3-mdnotes/example/markdown_introduction.html)

Presentation how elements in your `.md` files will be displayed on website. If you are new to Markdown it's good place 
to start with.

### [Third section: Test](https://ethru.github.io/pdoc3-mdnotes/example/test/index.html)

Enclosed information in this tab are introduction to `pytest`. Python testing framework. Don't treat it as source of 
knowledge. It may be outdated with time. This section is to demonstrate notes on technical topic and fact that 
directories containing code only (without `.md` files) were ignored.

***Note:** if you are not going to use this tool to work with code. This section won't be interesting for you. Of course
if you like be welcome to see website layout.*
